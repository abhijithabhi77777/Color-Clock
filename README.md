## Getting Started

This flutter app is part of an assignment by Bilomus community in the process of learning flutter.
The app consist of two windows

1. Splash screen
2. Analog clock screen

The app help the developers to understand the process of using exsting packages from pub dev

We use two packages
1.Splash Screen https://pub.dev/packages/splashscreen
2. Analog clock https://pub.dev/packages/analog_clock

Then we use a little customization to obtain the following result. The color of the clock is controlled by the three sliders which represent corresponding red, green and blue values.
